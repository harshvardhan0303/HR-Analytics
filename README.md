Moreover, the time to time update help the HR in analysing the Work from Home and half days taken by employees. It has also the section of Sick Leave which help the manager in taking the health precautions for the employees. 

## Solution Approach
In this context, firstly I have created the scenario by taking myself as manager and thinking what will be the answers I want and by asking the relevant questions with myself. After that I have gone through different approach taken by the students and professionals to answer these questions and their drawbacks.  In continuity based on my questions which I have framed myself I started creating measures accordingly. Once I have done with creating measures , I started creating visuals for the same in PowerBI and endup by creating dashboard, next important step is taking review for my dashboard which I have created for this I have taken help of my friends and what they suggested I have edited that as well.
